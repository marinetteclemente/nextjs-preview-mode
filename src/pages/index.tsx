            Five most favourite support tasks:<br />
            <br />
            1. Write and maintain support articles and docs pages: Maintaining the support articles and docs pages is crucial for the customer support role as it promotes three important things, efficiency, sharing of knowledge, and continuous improvement.<br /> 
            2. Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub: Improve my technical proficiency and problem-solving skills<br />
            3.  Help train and onboard new support teammates: It is a two-way kind of learning, not only the new onboarded teammates are benefitting but also the person who is doing the training as it enhances many skills <br />
            4. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers: Enhance skills such as collaboration, business requirement analysis, different project management methodologies<br />
            5. Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use: Enhance understanding in various customer support requests<br />
            <br />
            Five least favourite support tasks: <br />
            <br />
            1. Manage a support team: Focus on increasing my knowledge in the technicalities <br />
            2. Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day: Having to respond quickly could be overwhelming<br />
            3. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project: Can be time-consuming and challenging. Most of the time it requires high-level technical expertise<br />
            4. Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer: the lack of direct control over external parties<br />
            5. Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems: Can be challenging to balance the needs of different users <br />

            Specifically in the fields of modern web architecture. I have been involved working in SaaS platform and I really find it interesting on how the web architecture works. <br />
            Being involved in understanding the frontend frameworks like Next.js and React, cloud technologies, serverless computing and DNS would really be a good opportunity for me to dive in. <br />
            Strengthening my technical expertise will enable me to contribute more effectively to projects and problem-solving initiatives.<br />

            In a previous support role, I encountered a challenge where a specific customer cannot integrate their data system into our existing API key access <br />
            When investigated the issue, I discovered that the problem was related to absence of any API credentials on the customer's end. <br />
            Unfortunately, the customer's platform was a bit old and don't have the capability to connect through API access. <br />
            To address the issue, I have started planning out the next steps through: <br />
                * Internal collaboration: I have explained the situation to our system engineers and asked for their recommendations on any options we can provide to the customer.<br />
                  After them further investigating other methodologies for the customer, they have suggested an SFTP folder transfer of data instead of API connection. <br />
                * Technical Requirements gathering: I have set up a meeting with our customer's tech people along with our tech experts to discuss the potential technical requirements to pull off the requirement.  <br />
                * Resource allocation: After the technical kick off and confirming the possibility of the solution, I have coordinated the business sign off to our Customer Relations manager and our CTO to confirm the necessary work required for this request.  <br />
                * Implementation: After defining the objectives and the resource required, I have initiated the proposal to the customer, asking for their final sign off to push through the project. <br/>
                * Testing: After official sign off from the customer, and actual implementation by system engineers, we were able to pull the data from their SFTP folder and successfully built a standard ingestion that will be a repeatable process for the customer. <br />
          The success of the solution was determined by the on-going transfer of data that was reusable by other customers who doesn't have available API connection. <br/>

            In the customer support world, there will be scenarios where we face an issue which we are unfamiliar with. <br />
            In these cases, when I encounter a customer seeking assistance with a build issue on a framework or technology that I'm unfamiliar with, <br />
            I would approach the situation systematically to gather relevant information and eventually find out a solution for troubleshooting. <br />
            Firstly, I would conduct initial research to gain an understanding of the framework or technology.  <br />
            I will look for documentations or help file that could provide insights on the specific issue, or I would read through some forums or community resources. <br />
            I will also look for tutorials or guides related that could add to my knowledge. <br />
            Next step would be asking the customer to provide me more context of the issue like a detailed information about the specific build issue they are encountering.  <br />
            I will ask them to provide any evidence of the issue which would help me replicate it. I would request for any error messages or log issues, <br />
            if there were code recent code changes in their development environment, if there are dependencies in other configurations and any other third-party vendors.  <br />
            After getting the information by the customer, I would try to explore potential solutions with the issue.<br /> 
            This might involve troubleshooting common issues, experimenting with different configurations or even seeking assistance on any third-party vendors that would have greater knowledge.  <br />
            Lastly, resolve or not, I will document it with my findings, steps taken, and any progress made. <br/>
            This way, if the issue re-occur for another customer, there will be a documentation where other CS team members could refer to easily to resolve the issue. <br />
