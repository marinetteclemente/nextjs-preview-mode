            Five most favourite support tasks:<br />
            1. Write and maintain support articles and docs pages: Maintaining the support articles and docs pages is crucial for the customer support role as it promotes three important things, efficiency, sharing of knowledge, and continuous improvement.<br /> 
            2. Identify, file (and, where possible, resolve) bugs in private and public Vercel/Next.js repos on GitHub: Improve my technical proficiency and problem-solving skills<br />
            3.  Help train and onboard new support teammates: It is a two-way kind of learning, not only the new onboarded teammates are benefitting but also the person who is doing the training as it enhances many skills <br />
            4. Work with the product team to develop a new feature based on feedback from customers: Enhance skills such as collaboration, business requirement analysis, different project management methodologies<br />
            5. Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use: Enhance understanding in various customer support requests<br />
            
            Five least favourite support tasks: <br />
            1. Manage a support team: Focus on increasing my knowledge in the technicalities <br />
            2. Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day: Having to respond quickly could be overwhelming<br />
            3. Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project: Can be time-consuming and challenging. Most of the time it requires high-level technical expertise<br />
            4. Work with 3rd party partners to track down a tricky situation for a joint customer: the lack of direct control over external parties<br />
            5. Engage multiple users at once in a public discussion, to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems: Can be challenging to balance the needs of different users <br />

            Technical skills<br />
            Specifically in the fields of modern web architecture. I have been involved working in SaaS platform and I really find it interesting on how the web architecture works. <br />
            Being involved in understanding the frontend frameworks like Next.js and React, cloud technologies, serverless computing and DNS would really be a good opportunity for me to dive in. <br />
            Strengthening my technical expertise will enable me to contribute more effectively to projects and problem-solving initiatives.<br />
            
            Communication Skills <br />
           I would also like to further improve my communication skills. <br />
           It is crucial being a CSE, this includes relaying complex ideas effectively to the team and other stakeholders. <br />

          Imagine a customer writes in requesting help with a build issue on a framework or technology that you've not seen before. <br />

            In the customer support world, there will be scenarios where we face an issue which we are unfamiliar with. <br />
            In these cases, when I encounter a customer seeking assistance with a build issue on a framework or technology that I'm unfamiliar with, <br />
            I would approach the situation systematically to gather relevant information and eventually find out a solution for troubleshooting. <br />
            Firstly, I would conduct initial research to gain an understanding of the framework or technology.  <br />
            I will look for documentations or help file that could provide insights on the specific issue, or I would read through some forums or community resources. <br />
            I will also look for tutorials or guides related that could add to my knowledge. <br />
            Next step would be asking the customer to provide me more context of the issue like a detailed information about the specific build issue they are encountering.  <br />
            I will ask them to provide any evidence of the issue which would help me replicate it. I would request for any error messages or log issues,  <br />
            if there were code recent code changes in their development environment, if there are dependencies in other configurations and any other third-party vendors.  <br />
            After getting the information by the customer, I would try to explore potential solutions with the issue.<br /> 
            This might involve troubleshooting common issues, experimenting with different configurations or even seeking assistance on any third-party vendors that would have greater knowledge.  <br />
